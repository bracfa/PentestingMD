TCP Ports

Goal: Determine name and version of each open port

1. Scan all ports using Nmap SYN Stealth.
`sudo nmap -p- 192.168.182.71`
Note the **closed ports**, as perhaps they will be open in further enumeration.

2. Scan the open ports for service detection.
`sudo nmap -p22,25,80,445 -sV 192.168.182.71`
If the version number doesn't show for a service, **find another way to get the version number**

3. Perform aggressive scan. We have increasingly more data.
`sudo nmap -p22,25,80,445 -A 192.168.182.71`

4. Run the Nmap NSE scripts default, safe, auth, vuln on the open ports.
`sudo nmap -p22,25,80,445 --script default,safe,auth,vuln, 192.168.182.71`

Take note of:
-State: VULNERABLE
-passwords
-usernames
-robots.txt
-unusual ports

5. Create new sub-notebooks for each port/service name
