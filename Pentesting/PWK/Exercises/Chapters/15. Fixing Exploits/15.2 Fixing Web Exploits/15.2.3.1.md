# 15.2.3.1
## 15.2.3.1.1. Connect to your dedicated Linux lab client and start the apache2 service; the target web application is located under **/var/www/https/**.

Connect to the Linux lab client

## 15.2.3.1.2. Modify the original exploit and set the base_url variable to the correct IP address of your dedicated Linux lab client as well as the protocol to HTTPS.

Download the exploit
```
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/15_fixingExploits/cms$ searchsploit -m 44976
  Exploit: CMS Made Simple 2.2.5 - (Authenticated) Remote Code Execution
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44976
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/44976.py
File Type: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /home/kali/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/15_fixingExploits/cms/44976.py
```

Change the IP to the Linux lab client and protocol to HTTPS

## 15.2.3.1.3. Get familiar with the requests Python library and adjust your exploit accordingly to avoid SSL verification.
Here is confirmation that the code was changed
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/15_fixingExploits/cms$ cat 44976_modified.py | grep "verify=False"
    response  = requests.post(url, data=data, allow_redirects=False, verify=False)
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, files=txt, cookies=cookies, verify=False)
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, cookies=cookies, allow_redirects=False, verify=False)
```



## 15.2.3.1.4. Edit the username and password variables to match the ones from our test case (username “admin”, password “HUYfaw763”).

## 15.2.3.1.5. Try to run the exploit against the Linux lab client, does it work? If not, try to explain why.

Running the exploit does not work. The output from `location.split(csrf_param + "=")[1]` is expecting a value in index 1, but there is no value to return
