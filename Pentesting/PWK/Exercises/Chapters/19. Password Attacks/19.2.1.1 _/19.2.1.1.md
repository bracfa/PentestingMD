19.2.1.1

# 19.2.1.1.1. Add a user on your Kali system and specify a complex password for the account that includes lower and upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. Use both crunch rule patterns and pre-defined character-sets in order to generate a wordlist that include that userâ€™s password.

To generate a wordlist that contains password efsT7lkb!, we would run command
`crunch 9 9 -t @@@,%@@@^ -o crunch.txt`

To use the pre-defined character-sets like in /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst for password efsT7lkb!, run:
`crunch 8 8 -f /usr/share/crunch/chrarset.lst mixalpha-numeric-symbol14-sv -o crunch.txt`
