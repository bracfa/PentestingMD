# 19.3.4.1.2. Perform an FTP password attack against the Pure-FTPd application on your local machine

For this example, we were the ones who created the username and password from previous Chapter 16 (Page 478, Listing 464).Creds -> offsec:lab. Then, we created some wordlist and ensured that the password 'lab' was in it. Finally, run the hydra command
