7.1.6.3.

# 7.1.6.3.1. Find the DNS servers for the megacorpone.com domain.

## Forward Lookup Brute Force
The domain is megacorpone.com. Perform DNS queries to discover hostnames and IP addresses. We will use /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt as possible hostnames

## Reverse Lookup Brute Force 
When we sort for unique IPs, we find four of them:
3.211.51.86
3.212.85.86
3.220.61.179
3.220.87.155

Perform dns reverse lookup brute force on these 4 unique IPs. However, we were not able to resolve any more hostnames for megacorpone.com
