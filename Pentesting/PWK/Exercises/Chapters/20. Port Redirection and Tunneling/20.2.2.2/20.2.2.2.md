20.2.2.2

# 20.2.2.2.1. Connect to your dedicated Linux lab client client via SSH and run the **clear_rules.sh** script from **/root/posrt_forwarding_and_tunneling/** as root.
```plaintext
root@debian:~/port_forwarding_and_tunneling# ./clear_rules.sh 
root@debian:~/port_forwarding_and_tunneling# ./ssh_remote_port_forwarding.sh 
```


# 20.2.2.2.2. Close any SSH connections to your dedicated Linux lab client and then connect as the student account using **rdesktop** and run the **ssh_remote_port_forward.sh** script from **/root/port_forwarding_and_tunneling/** as root.

Check for SSH connections using the w command. There are no SSH connections
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ w

Connect to the Debian client via rdesktop
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ rdesktop 192.168.214.44 -u student -p lab

# 20.2.2.2.3. Attempt to replicate the SSH remote port forwarding covered in the above scenario and ensure that you can scan and interact with the MySQL service.

We will ssh out from our Debian client (192.168.214.44) to our Kali machine (192.168.119.214) and specify a remote forward. Before this, we open a listener on TCP port 2221 on our Kali machine (192.168.119.214:2221) and forward connections to the internal Linux machine's TCP port 3306 (127.0.0.1:3306). This will forward all incoming traffic on our Kali system's port 2221 to port 3306 on the Debian lient through the SSH tunnel (TCP 22), which allows us to reach the MySQL port even though it is filtered at the firewall.

Run the SSH command on Debian Linux for remote forward. After entering the password, the connection will seem to hang
```plaintext
student@debian:~$ ssh -N -R 192.168.119.214:2221:127.0.0.1:3306  kali@192.168.119.214

Validate the TCP port 2221 is listening on Kali
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ ss -antp | grep "2221"
LISTEN     0      128          127.0.0.1:2221         0.0.0.0:*                                           
LISTEN     0      128              [::1]:2221            [::]:*                                           
kali@kali:~$ 
```

Scan the localhost on Kali port 2221 with nmap
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS -sV 127.0.0.1 -p 2221
[sudo] password for kali:

Interact with Debian's mysql through Kali
