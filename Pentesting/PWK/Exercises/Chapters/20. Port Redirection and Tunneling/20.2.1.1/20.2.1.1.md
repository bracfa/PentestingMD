# 20.2.1.1.3. Take note of the Linux client and Windows Server 2016 IP addresses show in the Student Control Panel.

Kali				= 192.168.119.214
Linux (Debian)		= 192.168.214.44
Windows Server 2016	= 172.16.214.5



# 20.2.1.1.4. Attempt to replicate the smbclient enumeration covered in the above scenario. 

Change the Samba configuration on Kali machine to set the minimum SMB version to SMBv2 by adding "min protocol = SMB2" to the end of the file. Wny? Because Windows Server 2016 no longer supports SMBv1 by default.

```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf 
#
# Sample configuration file for the Samba suite for Debian GNU/Linux.
...
# Please note that you also need to set appropriate Unix permissions
# to the drivers directory for these users to have write rights in it
;   write list = root, @lpadmin
min protocol = SMB2
```

Restart the Samba service
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart
Restarting smbd (via systemctl): smbd.service.
```


Set-up port forwarding to bind port 445 on our local (Kali) machine (0.0.0.0:445) to port 445 on the Windows Server (172.16.214.5:445) and do this through a session to our original Linux target, logging in as student (student@192.168.214.44).

SSH using sudo. Once we enter the password, we notice that the connection hangs. At this point, we can run the smbclient tool
```plaintext
kali@kali:~/gitWorkspace/pwk/oscpExercises/20_portForwardingAndTunneling$ sudo ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:445:172.16.214.5:445 student@192.168.214.44
[sudo] password for kali: 
student@192.168.214.44's password: 

```

Run the smbclient command and enter the password when prompted
```plaintext
kali@kali:~$ smbclient -L 127.0.0.1 -U Administrator
Enter WORKGROUP\Administrator's password:
