# 16.1.3.2.2. Attempt to log in to the FTP server from a Netcat reverse shell and see what happens.

From Kali, netcat into the Debian client and ftp back into the Kali server. We see it is non-interactive. Then, netcat into the Debian client again and upgrade to an interactive shell using Python. Try to ftp back into the Kali box and we see it's interactive.
