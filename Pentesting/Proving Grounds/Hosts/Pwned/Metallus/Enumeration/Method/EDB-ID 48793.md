This took many reverts in order to run the exploit correctly

1. Port 40443
2. Google for default creds which is admin:admin
3. Confirm that admin:admin works. It works!
4. Notice the version number says Build 14700
5. Google `manageengine application manager build 14700 exploit`![fcb0cc1c25fe80caaa731b32d0d7778b.png](../../../../../_resources/8849ecc58d414d78bd6e5ecf6813afa8.png)

7. Download via `searchsploit -m 48793`
8. Check the usage. Notice that it requires a username and password, and that it's run using python3. I had to download openjdk-11-jdk so that javac would be found. No changes were made to the origina exploit. ![8b83254319b8cda4c0a14ee5df2b399e.png](../../../../../_resources/e0fb7c6589a844919df358474eeb22b6.png)
