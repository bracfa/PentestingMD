Lessons learned

# Lessons learned
## Searching for exploits
- (Wombo) sometimes you must broaden the search, example `redis 5.0.9 rce` vs `redis 5.0 rce`

## Trying exploits
- (Wombo) sometimes the service version specified in an exploit might be close enough to be worth a try. I had dimissed this earlier on because it said it only worked on <=5.0.5
