-(Wombo) why didn't payloads linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp or linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp in Metasploit using port 8080?
-(Wombo) redis SSH key exploit didn't work because I couldn't change folders
-(Wombo) nodebb account takeover didn't work, I couldn't change the uid using Burp on the websocket.io. Why not?
